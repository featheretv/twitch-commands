January 24, 1996. Dear Diary, Today was a terrible day. There was a sub. He's mean. I mean, very mean. His name is Mr. Gallagher. He won't let us use the bathroom, he won't let us talk, and he is a very, very, very mean teacher. He put our names up if we do anything wrong. I got my name up there. But it was my only warning. It was up there because I talked out about the division problem. All I said was "one". Well that's nothing to do with it. Danny and Danté were the badest. It was raining in the afternoon.

We were supposed to get P.E. But we didn't Nr. Gallagher took us our and waste our recess. Lesson. I HATE MEAN SUBSTITUTES.
January 31, 1996. Dear Diary, I kind of hate today. It was raining and sprinkling. I didn't get recess on the first morning but we get to play something about making a joke in class.

Glad that you're not sad.
February 7, 1996. Dear Diary, Today I am glad that Mr. Hopkins was still here today. Today wasn't great. Danté wasn't yelled at today because he wasn't here. I moved in front of Valerie now. Everyone moved. There was a big space in the middle. Robert Beasley is sitting by the sink alone. At lunch is was cool. Mr. Hopkins made everyone sing a stupid song I don't want to hear. Lesson. I hate songs that are stupid.
February 8, 1996. Dear Diary, Today I did much work but I didn't finish my math. It was kind of hard. I was wondering if the whole class can have a Valentine's Day Party. I'm not sure.

I also didn't get any homework. It was cool. Lesson. Get fun.
February 9, 1996. Dear Diary, Today Mr. Hopkins was too mad. I get to stand in line on the first recess. It was boring. I even didn't get my first recess. But I got my second. Everyone did. I keep fighting with Robert Velasco, James Buhain, and most of all Michael Bradley. I keep on hitting him. Lesson. I really want recess.
February 12, 1996. Dear Diary, Today was a good day but my right tooth hurted. It hurts bad. Anyway, in the morning, I helped Mr. Hopkins by holding his stuff. It wasn't that hard. The class didn't get shouted a lot, I showed Michael a picture about him when he was little but he folded it. It was just a picture. Now when I bring it home my brother is going to be mad. And he's going to tell, maybe. I'm going to get a list of names tomorrow for Valentine's Day. Lesson. Let's party on!
February 21, 1996. Dear Diary, Today was sort of a fun day. I forgot to write in you for days! I keep forgetting to do that. I am doing an art project in class a few hours ago. When Mr. Hopkins said Ojoqin, I got my name up on the board. It was bad because a few kids got on it too. I got a stupid, dumb, homework. Lesson. These things never come out that way.
March 12, 1996. Dear Diary, I know, I know. It's been a long time. I went to the library today. I moved when I went back to the classroom. I can see things close. But not close enough. I am proud because I am on the honor roll. I like it here when I moved desks. Daryl sitting way across me, not way across. He sits in my table. It was raining and I didn't get a chance to get recess. Now that it is March my birthday will be on this Friday. Lesson. I hate rainy days.
May 13, 1996. Dear Diary, I had a problem. So I cannot write in you. It's been two months since I wrote in you. I had 3 field trips and I am going to Coloma for another field trip but I don't know when. I had P.E. and a few substitute. I hope I didn't upset you. I put a Spottie Dottie sticker on the front cover. I hope you like it. I forgot to tell you about the days I had fun. I had to do two current events because the class was noisy. Lesson. I will try to write in you every school day.
June 19, 1996. Today is Saturday. Dad and Derek went fishing. School's over. I don't have any homework. My teacher was Mr. Hopkins. I went to the Water Sanitation/Flood Control District. It stinks. That was my first field trip. THe other one was to Angel Island. My mom went with me. It was fun. I also went on a hike. It was long but I didn't go all the way cause' it was closed. I picked some rocks and took it home. THey were cool and funny I took some pictures. P.S. I took a ferry (which is a big boat to take you to places by water. I saw a few brides.
July 1, 1996. Dear Diary, It's summer vacation. I can stop writing in you now. I went to Angel Island on June 5. It was fun. I'll see you next time. P.S. I was wondering if I will get a better teacher this year. I like my teacher Mr. Hopkins though. Lesson. ???
January 1, 1997. Dear Diary, Today I went to Grandma's house. Because it is Happy New Year's Day. My teacher is Mrs. Redlich. She is not strict like Mr. Hopkins. SHe is a nie lady. Mrs. Lee was an assistant. Now she is going to teach primary grade. I have her photo. Her signature is on the back. I will go to school on January 6, 1997. I will try to be good in school. I also put 100 dollars in my own account. I might add more next week.
January 2, 1997. Dear Diary, Today, I have been having fun. Only four more days of school. I have two kinds of homework. One, is the one I do at school. And the second is the homework at home. We call it the home homework. I have a new lamp. It's for me because my dad think's I need more room on my desk so that I can write with more room. Derek's room is kind of messy right now. He doesn't even write on the blue table anymore because I gave him my brown table. Mrs. Avera is a teacher exect I go to her class after 2nd recess from Tuesdays-Fridays and sometimes Mondays.
January 3, 1997. Dear Diary, Today, Derek, my brother, showed me a game. It's kind of like  snow exect it is his matress. The game is, is when you put the table under the matress, near the stuffed animals, you could slide down anyway with something slippery under yourself. It's really fun! There's this other game with the matress exect all you have to do is stand the matress up and climb up. I also played chess and checkers. Derek sometimes cheat. He says that he wins everytime I win. He could be such a pain! But I need him so that I don't be lonely.
January 4, 1997. Dear Diary, Today, Derek went to the bank to deposit $10.00. He had $50.00 last week. This week he has $60.00 in his account. But I have $100.00 in my account. Also we played with some kind of toys but we got in a fight. I watched almost five hours of T.V. I think it was 6 hours. My dad watched lots of T.V. Maybe the whole afternoon exect he went out to the supermarket. He also put some kind of bug repellent around the house and outside. Only two more days of school. That means I will have to go to school on Monday. I feel like I don't know where my seat is.
January 5, 1997. Dear Diary, Today I watched some T.V. Maybe 7 hours now. And I played with Derek. He begged because I won't play with him. I got kind of bored, so I decided to go inside. When I was taking a shower. I noticed my ring was missing. I looked on my bed because that's where I would leave it. I asked Derek. It was in his room all the time. Only I have to go to school tomorrow. I just can't wait to go to school. Exect I left my calandar there! I was supposed to bring it home but I have to bring it tomorrow. I just kind-of hate myself.
January 6, 1997. Dear Diary, Today, I went to school. I had lots of work. At least I finished them all. In the mail, I got a letter from the Union Bank of California. It said that I have $100.01. They added one cent. That was kind of stupid. In the car, I barf at the back. It was nasty! Even Romeo saw it. It wasn't my fault. Let's just say it's nobody's fault. I ate cheese and ham sandwich plus a vitasoy drink. I figure my problem. Vitasoy and cheese and ham sandwich don't mix. I don't blame my mom. She was nice to me anyway. I took a shower when I got home. My mom cleaned the mess up. All was going fine.
January 7, 1997. Dear Diary, Today, I went to Mrs. Avera's class We studied about Martin Luther King Jr. Today was Mrs. Toliver's birthday. I didn't give her anything. But she didn't mind. I felt okay after the throw up (or should I say "barf".) I had to study math. I also had math for homework. It was easy. I had sentences to do tonight, but I already finish them. I finished all my homework. I miss Miss Lee though. She was the best assistant there ever was. I hate school days because you have to do homework and schoolwork. Most important of them all was no watching T.V. That's no fair.
January 8, 1997. Dear Diary, Today is a bad day. I should have blown that horn Mrs. Toliver gave me. Because I wouldn't do homework. I had to write an essay about how to get in line. It was Darnell's fault. He made me. He'll pay for this! Exect the math was easy. It was no big deal. I blew the horn two times in Mrs. Toliver's class because they were noisy. I gave Derek one, but he ruined it. He kept the thing that makes the sound. I watched a movie today. I think this day wasn't so bad after all.
January 9, 1997. Dear Diary, Today I went to school. We had to do out daily editing. I hate it. And our daily math. I finished all of it. I ate Nachos and Cheese. It was good. Exect I didn't finish it. I didn't have enough time to eat it. after I ate, I went to the Library because Mrs. Toliver was always there on Thursdays. That was there Library day. At 1.15 p.m. I went back to Mrs. Toliver's class. I played with Regina's computer game. It was fun. I had silent reading when I went back to the classroom. We had to do some Chinese caligraphy and a endangered species folder. I took it home so that I could do them. I also took the Chinese caligraphy.
January 10, 1997. Dear Diary, Today I was sick. I didn't go to school today. I tried to wake up, but I just felt weak. At 9.30, I woke up. I ate some chicken noodle soup. After that, I did my endangered species folder. I finished at 1.15. I wanted to go to school at 12.30 except I was eating chicken noodle soup. I did my Chinese caligraphy. It was very hard than I thought. It took me almost 3 hours to get it straight and complete. My mom told me the words didn't make any sense. This was Japanese caligraphy. I just call it Chinese. After I was finished, it was good. It looked great! And I absolutely positively did not copy it!
January 11, 1997. Dear Diary, Today I woke up because my mom and dad told me that we were going to the airport. Because my mom's older sister was going to be there. My mom's sister lives in Canada. She just came back to San Francisco because the plane needed some cleaning. She brought my mom and a person that babysits from Hong Kong. My mom's sister was supposed to go to Canda. We went to a place to eat. Derek wanted to buy some candy but we didn't have enough time. So my dad, my mom, my brother, the babysitter, the man, my mom's sister, and of course, me went to the airport once again. We had to ride on escalators and walkways. It was fun and took a long walk. I took some driver's license when I went back home.
January 12, 1997. Dear Diary, Today I went shopping. I went to the Union Bank because Derek wanted to deposit money. Early in the morning Derek and I played Donkey Kong Country I. I needed some help. Back to Business. After I went to the Union Bank, I went to Target. I went to the video games and toys. My dad and my mom bought some cleaning stuff and some food. I get to eat int he car when we were going to Safeway. It was sprinkling and raining. We went to SavMac to buy some food. I bought a puzzle ball. Me and Derek tried to take it out but we can't. At Raley's I was the only one that stayed in the car. And I took the pieces out. It's hard to put them back on.
January 13, 1997. Dear Diary, Today I went to school. I felt better. I finished my endangered species book. I only got up to H. I will be going on starting with the letter "I". Did I tell you that I finished my caligraphy. I went to Mrs. Toliver's class today. I corrected some papers. I finished my lunch there. I also had homework.
January 14, 1997. Dear Diary, Today, in the morning, I saw lots of ice in the grass. I didn't really saw it. It was someone in class that was talking about it. During class we have to do some kind of math. It was an activity. Me and Brian were partners. Brian didn't do much. I did most of the work. We got finished. We didn't get to finish our caligraphy or the Endangered Species Folder.
January 15, 1997. Dear Diary, Today I get to finish my Endangered Species ABC Book. This time I got to J though. THe J stands for Jaguar. I went to the Library today. I checked a fiction book. It was called "If I Had My Way." I didn't read it yet. I read Ranger Rick books. After that, I went to the Computer Lab. We can't have free choice so we had to do multiplication and division. I switched it the other side and played addition.
January 16, 1997. Dear Diary, Today I did lots of things. I did my daily math and my editing. I didn't get to finish my Endangered Animals ABC Book. We had to circle opinions and underline the facts or reasons. Its not fair that Brandon gets to play the computer. Also, he dig in everybody's passwords. Even mine. This time I hate him more than retarted people. He is an unfriendly friend if you ask me. I think he is stupid. He also thinks he is cool and funny even though he isn't. I cleaned my desk around 2.00 pm. My desk was a mess! At least I cleaned it. And yesterday, and the day before that, I made a diogramma or something like that.
January 17, 1997. Dear Diary, Today was Friday. It was the best day of the week. You get no homework and also you are day off on the weekends. But I get day off on Monday because it was a holiday. Today I did lots of things. It was kind-of fast. I Also hate Brandon! He gets on my nerves! He is worse than Shannon. I hate him more than Shannon or Dante. He is the worst person in my life!! My dad bought some food from Burger King. We bought a happy meal for me and Derek. It was good.
January 20, 1997. Dear Diary, Sorry about the days. I went to Costco today. I bought markers. Yesterday, I went to Grandma's house to celebrate my dad's and cousin's birthday. My cousin's birthday is on Monday which is today. My dad's birthday is on this Friday but we celebrated yesterday. It was fun!
January 22, 1997. Dear Diary, Today I finished my endangered species ABC Book. At school, I had to do lots of things. I had to do my daily edit, my daily math, The Tropical Rainforest Quiz, had to go to the library, had to go to the computer lab, had lunch, help Mrs. Colburn, file some books, do some math, go to Mrs. Toliver's class, silent reading, and had a long time to go to the bathroom. It was raining hard today. It was a storm! I can't barely walk through it! It was pouring out there!
January 28, 1997. Dear Diary, Sorry about leaving you in all these days without writing. I had lots of things to do today. Clean up my room, file books, and etc. I don't want you to do these. I'm just saying the things I had to do today. I went to Mrs. Toliver's class to help but almost no help was needed. I had a substitute today. Her name was Mrs. H. I had a sub yesterday his name was Mr. Levy. He is king of nice. I also had P.E. today. It was fun!
February 2, 1997. Dear Diary, Today is February 1, 1997. Today is a special day. How? Today is Groundhog day! I didn't see any groundhogs though. We rented a video game. It's called Jeopardy. We rented it yesterday which is Saturday or February 1, 1997. It was fun and sometimes hard. I tried to win from the computer, but the computer keeps on winning. I know that nobody would beat the computer.
February 4, 1997. Dear Diary, Today I had to do lots of work. I had to do a persuadesive writing, my daily math, math, attendence, daily edit, and our play. Mrs. Avera made us write an essay about one black hero. Also, a few kids lost their part. I went to Mrs. Toliver's class and help her. I also went to the computer lab with her. I read Romeo's comic book about Sonic. It was exciting! I even almost lost Romeo's lead pencil. But thanks to Armando who found it.
February 19, 1997. Dear Diary, Today was a good day. I did my daily edit and my persuasive writing on my first period. On my second period I went to Mrs. Avera to practice the play that was on this Friday. On my third period I had math class. It was for two hours. My fourth period was to go to Mrs. Toliver's class to help. After that, everybody had to write line sentences. Brandon added a rule. It was all his fault that now I have to write 30 sentences. Last, I went to the computer lab. It was fun!
February 20, 1997. Dear Diary, Today I did my science book report. It was about Earth. I even drew the Solar System. My report was about 3 pages. From now on, I'm trying to write neat. Tomorrow I will be in a play. It is about Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, Jr. I am the secretary. I am in Scene 2 Act 2 I think. Also, I have only one line which is. "Reverend King, the President will see you now." My mom will watch the play tomorrow at 10.15. It would be great! I also remember my poem that was for homework all week.
February 21, 1997. Dear Diary, I did my persuasive essay and now I have to do my play. When I did the play my mom couldn't make it. So I did it in front of other people and the class. After our play, we have P.E. It was fun! I played volleyball. Then I have recess. Recess wasn't fun. Because some kids are not even following the playing rules. I played four-square and they are doing fasties, bubbles and even someone got out for that. Well, I got to go to sleep. Goodnight! P.S. I also have to study for a spelling bee!
February 25, 1997. Dear Diary, Today I didn't have any persuasive writing. I did my daily edit and corrected it. Then I had recess. I watched a movie. It was about the rainforest. Emily and Valerie were in student council and they talked about special days. I was going to tell other people that are in the honor roll this year get free sodas' from Mr. Hopkins. He told me to. But afterschool, (which was when I could get a free soda,) I couldn't make it. I also had P.E. It was fun and exciting! Everybody had to write something that was important about a rainforest and we had to draw. I hate drawing! It was the things that I hate to do!
April 1, 1997. Sorry it took me a l-o-n-g time to write to you I have so much to tell you. I'm in the sixth grade. My teacher's name is Mr. Solovieff. I think he's cool but he hates the class when it gets noisy. I finally have a boyfriend. His name rhymes with my dorky brother, Derek. He's a philipino boy. He's smart and funny and sort of cute. He looks like chinese, too. I told my mom about that but she didn't do anything. The science fair is coming up. Actually, it's tomorrow. Hey! WHat's that on your shirt? April Fools! I got more to tell you but I'm starting to get writer's cramp. So see ya! P.S. The most annoying person I've ever met is LaShanda! She plays too much!
April 5, 1997. Dear Diary, I just found out that Jennifer is gonna have a boyfriend! But I have to keep it a secret too.
April 9, 1997. Dear Journal, Today, had came out pretty good so far. Not many names are on the board. One name from my class and two names from Room 33. I can't believe how bad they are. Yesterday my class had lottery. I can't believe I won! That was the second time that I won. I was surprised. I'm a teacher's helper. I help my teacher correct papers and stuff. I go to Mrs. Toliver's class and help at starting 12:45 and stop at 1:45. Of course I get to eat, silly! I have so many things I don't know what I'm doing. Did I tell you that my teacher is Mrs. Redlich? She teaches 5th graders. And Mrs. Toliver teachers 2nd and 3rd grade. She only has 20 students. My class has about 31 students. Yesterday, we started moving because during spring vacation, the custodian moved our desk the wax the floor. Well, I gotta go now. See ya!
August 21, 1997. Today I'm in training for conflict manager. I started on Monday and tomorrow I will be ending my training. I gotta go go to sleep so bye!
September 28, 1998. Today when I got home the phone rang. I said, "Hello?" They said, "Hi. Is Derek's mother home?" I said, "No." They said, "Is Derek's dad home?" I said, "No." They said, "Who is this?" I said it was Derek's sister. I said, "What happened?" They said, "Derek's head hurt" They asked me where my mom and dad. I said my mom and dad are at work. My mom's work is near Office Depot.
November 16, 1998. Dear Diary, Hi. I hope you still remember me. I have a lot of stuff to tell you. I'm in the 7th grade. My 6 teachers are okay, but I don't know about Mr. Lavoy. He is totally weird. My boyfriend and I are getting along pretty good. He sometimes give me money for no reason. I'm going to a field trip to San Francisco to the Exploratorium on December 4th. I just feel like hugging my boyfriend right now, but he's not here and I want to hug him alone. My brother Derek is getting okay. Hey! He has braces! I'm feeling fine right now. My friend Diane is like she needs help on everything. I'm not saying she's bad, but it's just that I feel right if she does it herself. Well, that's all I can tell you so far. I'm really sorry I didn't write to you for a long period of time. See ya cuddy! Lesson. Be friendly and watch out
January 1, 2000. Dear Diary, I just wanna tell you happy Millenium and that I really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really miss my ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-boyfriend Erik. He was the nicest b/f I have ever had and now I'm really like "Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely." I swear (SORRY) that the song really makes me cry because I think of Erik practically everyday. It makes me cry just to think of him. Today I saw him walk home and he waved to me and I waved back at him. It was like the only real b/f I have ever had "CRY"
